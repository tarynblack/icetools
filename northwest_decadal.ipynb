    "We obtained terminus positions from SAR images taken by the Sentinel-1 and Radarsat-1 satellites for 11 of the 47 years in our record. These satellites use C-Band wavelengths, which allows them to image the surface regardless of clouds or darkness. For the most recent six years (2014-2015 through 2019-2020), we traced terminus positions in mosaics of contemporaneous Copernicus Sentinel-1A/B images (`Joughin et al., 2016`). These mosaics are typically created from images acquired in early February of their respective years and have 50-m resolution. Radarsat-1 mosaics were used to trace terminus positions for six winter (2000-2001, 2005-2009, 2012-2013) (`Joughin et al., 2017`; `Moon & Joughin, 2008`). These mosaics are formed from images collected from October through March and have nominal resolutions of 20 m.\n",
    "\n",
    "We used imagery from all Landsat missions to map terminus positions for the remaining 36 years in our record, and for individual glaciers that were missing from or indiscernible in the SAR imagery. The majority of Landsat images used are from spring (March - May), although all months except January and December are represented. The resolution of these images ranges from 15 m (Landsat 8 panchromatic band) to 60 m (Landsat 1-5 Multispectral Scanner). We prescreened images in the USGS Global Visualization Viewer (GloVis) to confirm that glaciers of interest were not obscured by clouds and that the images were georeferenced well. Improper georeferencing can be an issue with older Landsat imges, so we compared our prospective images against known well-georeferenced images to ensure their accuracy. Due to winter darkness, it was not possible to select images from the same time of year as the SAR mosaics; instead, we chose images as close to winter as possible, with a preference for spring over fall to capture a more winter-like state to reduce the effects of seasonal variation. Because of the difficulty in finding sunlit, cloud-free imagery over each glacier, we could not acquire images at the same time every year for a given glacier, and for several years there was no viable imagery at all for some glaciers."

    "## 2.3 Glacier Area Change\n",
    "We calculated glacier area change over time using the box method (`Moon & Joughin, 2008`). Each glacier has a static, open-ended rerference box that approximately delineates the main region of ice flow. The box sides are roughly parallel to ice flow, and the box 'back' is perpendicular to ice flow at an arbitrary location up-glacier of the extent of maximum observed terminus retreat. Where a terminus trace intersects the open end of the box, a polygon is formed, and the area of that polygon represents the glacier's reference area at that point in time. Repeating this process for each terminus trace for a glacier forms a time series of reference areas, from which we determine the annual area change. While the areas are arbitrarily determined by the box size, the area differences between successive terminus traces represent the annual gain or loss of area.\n",
    "\n",
    "Errors in the area change calculation may come from inaccurate and missing terminus observations, and from possible seasonal variability of terminus locations. In years where no observations were made, we linearly interpolated between the prior and subsequent observations to estimate glacier areas during the missing years ([Fig. 2b](#figure-2b)). For glaciers with missing observations in the beginning of the record, we did not interpolate prior to the first observation in the record.\n",
    "\n",
    "```Another source of error might be seasonal variability. Do this analysis... Note that seasonal variability could provide some short-term variability but it should even out over longer periods.```\n",
    "```Say something about how focusing on area change removes the arbitrariness of how the box is drawn. It's hard to compare glaciers of different sizes; doesn't account for terminus width vs area change (look at length changes). Check that all traces were converted to areas.```\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to compare area change trends between glaciers of different sizes, we also determined the percent area change over time for each glacier. In an individual glacier area time series, we set the minimum glacier area as 0% and the maximum glacier area as 100%, and linearly scaled the other measured areas between those set points. This method places every glacier on the same 0-100% scale and excludes the arbitrariness of the glacier box size, allowing straightforward comparison of glacier area changes. `MOVE TO RESULTS!` `Make clear the purpose of doing this - to show timing similarities for different glaciers without the changes being swamped by large glaciers.
